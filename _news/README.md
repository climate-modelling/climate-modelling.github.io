# README

To add a new item create a new file with the format:  `%Y-%m_%d.md`. The file should then have a YAML frontmatter with the date of the news. Note that only the year and the month is currently rendered in the home page. The content is rendered in markdown.

Example:

```
---
date: "1998-04-08"
---
Something **very exciting** happened.

```
