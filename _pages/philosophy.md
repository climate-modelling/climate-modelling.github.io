## Inclusivity and diversity

## Mental Health

## Open science

## Conference Logistics

## Attending conferences

## Working hours

We have flexible working hours. Some people are more productive in the morning,
others during the day or later in the afternoon, evening or possibly even night.
That's okay. Core hours for most are 10am-4pm plus minus an hour or so but that
can also vary throughout the week. If other hours work better for you
feel free to communicate this so that other group members have an idea when
you can be reached and when not.

## Working days and remote working

The [Oxford student handbook](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/student-handbook)
technically requires students to live within 25km of the Carfax Tower.
Depending on the direction, one might have a faster commute from London Paddington
though. The philosophy of this research group is not to restrict people's whereabouts
but to encourage some in person presence, ideally during the core days Tue, Wed, Thu.
These days are chosen to better facilitate weekend travels but also to have some
days with a lower frequency of scheduled meetings.

## Group meetings

## Invidiual meetings

## Collaborative work

## Communication

Most of our communication happens through Slack. This is so that people feel
more encouraged to write shorter messages, can edit what they wrote, more easily
attach or detach media and particularly to have a communication platform that
is different from email. Email has its use but team communication is not necessarily
its strength. Whichever way you prefer to communicate is up to you but Milan
will be most responsive on Slack.

Depending on time and given the flexible working hours responses are rarely
imminent but we try to respond to group internal messages within a day or so.
This is no hard requirement and there will be many exceptions to this rule
of thumb but often it is also just nice to establish a responsive communication
culture where we can support each other, help with IT, math or physics questions,
etc. No one is expected to respond outside of their typical working hours.

One-on-one communication is normally treated confidentially particularly
non-science matters of personal nature that is communicated because it
impacts or can impact your or other people's work within our research group.
You are always free and encouraged to raise issues through communication
with others and demand them to make time for an apropriate discussion on these
issues. It is usually better to communicate but if you feel uncomfortable
to do so it is unlikely your fault rather there is insufficient space and 
time created to raise it.

## Social media and online presence

## Vacation

The UK has 8 [public holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) per year.
In addition to those every member of the research group is expected to
take about 5-6 weeks of vacation per year.
The [Oxford student handbook](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/student-handbook)
is not explicit about this but 5 weeks are typical. Working in academia
can be very stressful at times and so taking time off to unwind is highly
recommended. Some people need more vacation than others and that is okay,
Milan does not count his days off and so also does not expect others to do so.
He often combines professional trips to conferences or meetings with personal
holidays to minimize travel time, costs and emissions and you are free to do
so as well. 

Individual days off generally do not have to be communicated unless conflicting
with specific meetings (especially those that were difficult to schedule),
conferences, submission deadlines, or similar. Longer holidays can just be
informally communicated so that other members of the group are aware
that no response to communication has to be expected. Plan and communicate those
ideally a little further ahead but in general no permission is required.
Milan believes vacation flexibility can massively contribute to
personal wellbeing in academia by making space for other important things in life.

Many thanks to those for publicly sharing their implementation of a progressive research group philosophy
and more generally their contribution to making academia a welcoming place for everyone.
