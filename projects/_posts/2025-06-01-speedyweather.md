SpeedyWeather.jl is a global atmospheric model with simple physics developed as a research playground with an everything-flexible attitude as long as it is speedy. It is easy to use and easy to extend, making atmospheric modelling an interactive experience -- in the terminal, in a notebook or conventionally through scripts.

See the repository [github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl) for more information.
